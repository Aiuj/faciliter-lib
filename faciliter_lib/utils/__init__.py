"""faciliter_lib.utils

Convenience imports for the `faciliter_lib.utils` package.

Exports a small, stable surface so consumers can do::

    from faciliter_lib.utils import AppSettings, LanguageUtils

The package intentionally re-exports only the primary utilities implemented
in the package to keep the public API small and predictable.
